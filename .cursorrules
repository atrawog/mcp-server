# MCP Server Integration for Cursor

This project uses Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. While Cursor doesn't have native MCP support yet, you can:

1. Use MCP servers via Claude Desktop or other MCP-compatible clients
2. Run MCP servers locally and interact with them through their APIs
3. Use the MCP SDK to build custom integrations

## Setup Instructions

1. Install MCP SDK:
   ```bash
   npm install @modelcontextprotocol/sdk
   # or
   pip install mcp
   ```

2. Configure your MCP server in this directory
3. Run the server and connect via supported clients
